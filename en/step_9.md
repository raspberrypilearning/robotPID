## Other uses for PID

The input and outputs of a PID controller don’t have to be an encoder and a motor; the controller can be applied to any situation where something needs to be constantly monitored and adjusted. This could be:
 
* Using a magnetometer to make a robot move in a certain direction

* Keeping a camera on a powered mount pointing at the same place

* Making a robot follow a wall by measuring the distance to it with ultrasonic sensors

PID controllers are universal devices and the rules can be applied to solve many different problems.
